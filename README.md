# facerecbackend
This is the backend side of my facerec project. It uses node express to handle the requests for specific routes.
The database will consists of user information, login details with passwords encrypted using the bcrypt.node.js package and the count of faces recgonised by the user.
This is still a work in progress as I have hardcoded a user database but i will eventually use SQL and have the nodeserver connected to the database.
